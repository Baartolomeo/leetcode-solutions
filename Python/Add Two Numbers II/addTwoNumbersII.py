"""Description.

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:
    Input: 
        l1 = [7,2,4,3],
        l2 = [5,6,4]
    Output: 
        [7,8,0,7]
